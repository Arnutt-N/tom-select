# Level 2 Functionality Testing Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive manual testing checklist for validating the remote data loading functionality.

## Test Environment Setup

1. **Prerequisites**
   - [ ] Node.js and npm installed
   - [ ] Run `npm install` to install dependencies
   - [ ] Run `npm run dev` to start development server
   - [ ] Open browser to `http://localhost:5173`

## Core Functionality Tests

### 1. Remote Select Initialization
**Test**: Remote select component loads and initializes properly

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to the remote select section
2. Verify the select element is present and styled correctly
3. Check browser console for initialization messages

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Remote select element is visible
- [ ] Placeholder text "Type to search remote data..." is shown
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console
- [ ] Console shows "Remote select initialized successfully"
- [ ] Mock API interceptor is active (check console for "[MockAPI] Interceptor setup complete")

### 2. Mock API Integration
**Test**: Mock API responds to search requests

**Steps**:
1. Click on the remote select input field
2. Type "JavaScript" in the search box
3. Wait for results to appear

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Loading state appears briefly
- [ ] Search results containing "JavaScript" are displayed
- [ ] Results include items like "JavaScript", "React", "Node.js"
- [ ] Each result shows name, description, and avatar
- [ ] Console shows API request logs: "[MockAPI] Search request: "JavaScript""

### 3. Search Functionality
**Test**: Various search scenarios work correctly

**Search Tests**:
1. **Empty Search**: Clear input, verify all items shown
2. **Partial Match**: Search "React" - should show React-related items
3. **Language Filter**: Search "Python" - should show Python items
4. **Category Filter**: Search "Framework" - should show frameworks
5. **No Results**: Search "NonExistentTech" - should show "No results found"

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Empty search shows all available items (paginated)
- [ ] Partial matches work correctly
- [ ] Search is case-insensitive
- [ ] No results message appears for invalid searches
- [ ] Results are returned within reasonable time (< 1 second)

### 4. Statistics Display
**Test**: Statistics are updated and displayed correctly

**Steps**:
1. Click the "📊 Stats" button
2. Perform several searches
3. Observe statistics updates

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Stats button toggles statistics display
- [ ] API Requests section shows:
  - Total requests count increases
  - Success rate shows 100% (or close)
  - Average response time displayed
  - Error count remains at 0
- [ ] Cache Performance shows:
  - Cache size increases with searches  
  - Hit rate improves with repeated searches
  - Memory usage is tracked
- [ ] Connection Status shows:
  - Status: "Online"
  - Pending requests: 0
  - Fallback items count
- [ ] Tom-Select Stats show:
  - Total options count
  - Selected items count

### 5. Caching System
**Test**: Caching improves performance for repeated searches

**Steps**:
1. Clear stats and cache using "🗑️ Clear Cache" button
2. Search for "JavaScript" (first time)
3. Note the response time
4. Clear the search and search for "JavaScript" again (second time)
5. Compare response times

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] First search takes longer (API call)
- [ ] Second search is faster (cache hit)
- [ ] Cache hit rate increases
- [ ] Cache size shows stored entries
- [ ] Clear cache button resets statistics

### 6. Error Handling
**Test**: System handles errors gracefully

**Error Scenarios**:
1. **Network Simulation**: Use browser dev tools to simulate offline mode
2. **API Errors**: Mock API has ~5% error rate, perform many searches to trigger errors

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Network offline shows appropriate message
- [ ] API errors don't crash the interface
- [ ] Error count in statistics increases appropriately
- [ ] User sees meaningful error messages
- [ ] System falls back to cached data when possible

### 7. Offline Support
**Test**: Offline functionality works correctly

**Steps**:
1. Disconnect network (dev tools offline mode)
2. Perform searches
3. Reconnect network

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Offline indicator appears when network disconnected
- [ ] Search still works using fallback data
- [ ] Connection status shows "Offline"
- [ ] Fallback items count is displayed
- [ ] System detects when back online

### 8. Control Buttons
**Test**: All control buttons function correctly

**Button Tests**:
1. **🔄 Reload**: Clears current options and forces fresh data
2. **📊 Stats**: Shows/hides statistics display
3. **🗑️ Clear Cache**: Resets cache and statistics

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Reload button clears current selection and options
- [ ] Reload button shows loading state during reload
- [ ] Stats button toggles display correctly
- [ ] Clear cache resets all statistics to zero
- [ ] Clear cache shows confirmation feedback

### 9. User Interface States
**Test**: UI states display correctly during various operations

**UI State Tests**:
1. **Loading State**: Search for new terms to see loading
2. **Error State**: Trigger errors to see error styling
3. **Empty State**: Search for non-existent terms
4. **Success State**: Normal search results

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Loading spinner/indicator appears during API calls
- [ ] Error states show red styling and error messages
- [ ] Empty states show appropriate "no results" messages
- [ ] Success states show results with proper styling
- [ ] Transitions between states are smooth

### 10. Performance Validation
**Test**: System performs well under various conditions

**Performance Tests**:
1. **Rapid Searching**: Type quickly and verify debouncing
2. **Large Result Sets**: Search for common terms
3. **Memory Usage**: Perform many searches and check for leaks

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Rapid typing is debounced (not every keystroke triggers API call)
- [ ] Large result sets load without performance issues
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable after extended use
- [ ] Statistics show reasonable response times (< 1000ms)

## Advanced Testing

### 11. Accessibility
**Test**: Component is accessible to screen readers and keyboard users

**Steps**:
1. Navigate using only keyboard (Tab, Enter, Arrow keys)
2. Test with screen reader (if available)
3. Check ARIA attributes in dev tools

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] All functionality accessible via keyboard
- [ ] ARIA labels and descriptions present
- [ ] Screen reader announces state changes
- [ ] Focus management works correctly

### 12. Mobile Responsiveness
**Test**: Interface works on mobile devices/small screens

**Steps**:
1. Use browser dev tools to simulate mobile devices
2. Test portrait and landscape orientations
3. Verify touch interactions

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Statistics grid adapts to small screens
- [ ] Touch interactions work correctly
- [ ] Text remains readable on small screens
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling required

```bash
# Run the functionality test script
node src/test-functionality.js
```

This will execute all programmatic tests and provide a detailed report of passing/failing functionality.
